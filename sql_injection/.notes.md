# SQL injection Notes

Extract tables from the database, MySQL
```sql
' union select TABLE_NAME, table_type FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES; #
```
The system table INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES contains information of all tables in the server.The TABLE_NAME field obviously contains the name of each table in the database. It was chosen because we know it always exists.
